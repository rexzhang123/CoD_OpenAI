"With house prices soaring, it's not easy finding somewhere to live. And this community has thrown in the towel. Meet Seattle's rolling neighborhood of RVs, where each unassuming vehicle is a capsule home. The unusual format has been captured in a series of photographs by visual journalist Anna Erickson. Meet Bud Dodson, 57, and welcome to his home: An RV in Seattle's SoDo where he watches over the parking lot in exchange for a spot . No place like home: John Warden, 52, has turned his $200 vehicle into his home after his apartment burned down years ago . There are around 30 drivers that float in and out of this parking lot in the SoDo (South of Downtown) area of the city in Washington State. One might not notice them in the mornings as hundreds of workers in the nearby factories, such as Starbucks, park up and rush into work. But on the weekends, as the rabble flocks back to their beds, this unique group remains. John Worden, 52, has been living in his vehicle for years since his apartment burned down and he was left homeless. He told Anna his car cost $200, and doesn't drive very well. But for a home, it's just about enough. Though plan on the outside, it is a Pandora's Box inside, Anna tells DailyMail.com. 'It was scattered with trinkets that he had been collecting over the years,' she explained, 'and a pile of beer cans that he was saving to turn in for money.' For work, he panhandles while helping people find parking spaces at Safeco Field stadium, where he used to be a cook. People come and go for work in the factories nearby, but on the weekend it is just the RV-dwellers that area left . Daily life: Here Bud can be seen preparing himself a barbecue on the gravel outside his capsule home, one of about 30 in the community . Eclectic: While Bud's RV is organized and functional, John's is full of trinkets and belongings dating back years . Alongside him - most of the time - is Bud Dodson, 57. While some are forced to move about regularly, Dodson, a maintenance man, looks after the parking lot in exchange for a semi-permanent spot. His home has its own unique stamp on it. 'He had really made the RV his home and taken good care of it,' Anna described. 'It was more functional [than John's] and a cleaner space with a bed, kitchen and bathroom.' Whether organized or eclectic, however, each one is home. 'None of them seem to want to move on,' Anna said. 'It's not perfect but they seem pretty content. Move in, move out: Some have agreements to stay, but others have to keep driving around to find a spot . John works as a panhandler at Safeco Fields stadium, where he used to work as a cook . He is content with his life in between the usual confines of society . Personal: To many this may just seem like a parking lot but for these men it is a very personal space . 'Bud is very grateful, he said the parking lot owner is just such a nice guy to let him live like this.' She came across them when she stopped to ask a seemingly homeless man for directions. 'We got talking,' she said, 'and he mentioned that he lived nearby in an RV. I went round to look and there was a whole bunch of them.' Curious, she spent about two months returning to the spot, meeting with the community and building their trust. 'These RVs are their homes so it's a very personal thing,' she explained.","Around 30 people live a floating life in Seattle's SoDo (South of Downtown) area in their RVs .

"An author has claimed that 'people are ready' for his forthcoming play which stars impressionist Alistair McGowan as the disgraced paedophile Jimmy Savile. Journalist Jonathan Maitland said while there had been some shock at the drama, An Audience with Jimmy Savile, the majority of critics are eager to know when they will be able to see it. It will open in London in June, less than three years since the late comedian's depraved behaviour was exposed in a television documentary. Scroll down for video . The author of a play which sees impressionist Alistair McGowan portray Jimmy Savile has said the public is ready for it to be shown . The revelation that Savile had abused dozens of children and young women in hospitals and schools throughout the 70s and 80s sparked an enormous Scotland Yard probe into other alleged abuse. Although some lines of inquiry are still ongoing, Maitland claims now is an appropriate time to thrust the subject into the arts. In an interview with The Guardian he said: 'It has changed everything; it has changed the way we look at abuse, it has changed the way we prosecute it, it has changed attitudes towards it, the way we treat the survivors of it. 'What person would not want to explore what kicked it off?' Drawing on interview transcripts and statements provided to the police by some of Savile's many victims, the play's central role has been given to impressionist Alistair McGowan. Most often recognised for his comedic performances, Maitland said his leading actor is also 'terrific' at embodying the 'dark, nasty' elements of the story. In his popular BBC series, The Big Impression, McGowan included Savile in a bizarre comedy sketch in which he portrayed American rapper Eminem. McGowan previously portrayed the comedian in his popular series The Big Impression. In a sketch he responds to a teenage Eminem's repeated requests to appear on Jim'll Fix It . Twitter users rejected Maitland's claim the public was 'ready' for the play, describing the subject choice as 'unbelievable' Dressed in a blue and white tracksuit similar to those worn by Savile, McGowan writes to the Jim'll Fix It host to ask whether he could appear on the programme with his mother to whom he is violent. Later he impersonates Savile himself, responding: 'It would be hard to let you hurt your mum on the TV, especially at tea time.' Sinisterly, he then tells the fictional teenage Eminem that the pair could go to Alton Towers 'in a few hours' before giggling and licking his lips. Author Jonathan Maitland said people were 'ready' for the play to be shown less than three years after the abuse was exposed . Before opening to the public the play will hear findings of the Dame Janet Smith's inquiry into abuse at the BBC. While Maitland said he will be happy to adjust any contentious parts to its liking, he is confident the public, and Savile's victims, will be prepared for the drama. 'Yes it will be strange to see someone doing him for the first time, but I think people are ready.' Critics have however slammed his 'unbelievable' subject choice. One Twitter user said it was 'not quite right' to portray the scandal, while another commented: 'Why not make Fritzl the musical?', referring to the Austrian predator Josef Fritzl who imprisoned his daughter for 24 years to carry out horrific sexual abuse. John Caswell refuted Maitland's claim that the public were ready, responding: 'It's official, I am not people'. But a lawyer acting on behalf of 178 of the comedian's victims said she had met with the playwright and was satisfied the play had been produced in good taste. 'From what Jonathan has told me it will be extremely sensitive and will not in anyway undermine the seriousness of the subject ,' said Liz Dux, specialist abuse lawyer at Slater & Gordon. 'After meeting with him and discussing the project at length , I'm satisfied he will not cause offence to any of the victims . In fact some have agreed to meet with him.' An Audience with Jimmy Savile is the author's second play. His first, Dead Sheep, is being shown at the Park Theatre.

"The morning after the row the night before, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg barely exchanged a word in the first-class cabin of their Emirates flight to Dubai, en route to the next race in Bahrain. If the two Mercedes drivers are not quite on non-speaking terms, they are communicating only when they have to. While they kept quiet among themselves, both had a further say in public about the dispute that broke out after the Chinese Grand Prix. Hamilton was particularly strident saying that the difference is that he is a ‘racer’ and Rosberg is not. Lewis Hamilton (right) and Nico Rosberg have both had their say on Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix . Winner Hamilton (centre) waves to the crowd as Rosberg (left) and Sebastian Vettel shake hands . Briefly, the bones of the argument are these. Rosberg, who was beaten into second place by Hamilton, said his team-mate had been ‘selfish’ by slowing down while leading the race. It caused him (Rosberg) to be bunched up closer to the attacking Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, whom he feared could overhaul him. Vettel did not manage to do so and finished third. The verbal spat played out at the press conference as the two protagonists sat side by side. Rosberg fumed. Hamilton smiled, seemingly happy to have riled his title rival. But it can now be revealed what happened after they finished their subsequent round of interviews in the Shanghai paddock on Sunday night. Both went through their usual engineering debriefs before being brought in one by one to meet senior Mercedes management including Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe, team principal and technical director respectively. Hamilton went in first and was in conversation with his bosses for half an hour. Rosberg for 20 minutes, now in a room illuminated by lights as darkness crept in outside. Then, more than two hours after the race had finished, Wolff was happy the team had got their story straight enough to speak to journalists. It was now 90 minutes after his scheduled press conference. Rosberg (left) was clearly angry with Hamilton in Sunday's press conference and hit out at his team-mate . The British driver (right) denied he had done anything wrong following Rosberg's accusations . Hamilton (right) backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race . He declared the talks ‘positive’ and cleared both his drivers of wrongdoing. Hamilton then spoke to the press under an embargo that mean his words have not appeared until now. ‘Nico didn’t try,’ he said with passion, often repeating his words for emphasis. ‘Nico didn’t try. ‘They said maybe he was just comfortable in second place and I said, “Well that’s the difference between us. I want to win always.” ‘And I would have done everything to get past today. Or at least pushed for three laps. He wasn’t quick enough. ‘This is motor racing, man. Racing. Don’t take away the fun of the racing. It’s racing. I wouldn’t have sat back two seconds to make it to the end of the stint. ‘I don’t even know what Nico’s point is. Where we are is that I just won the race today. I did the best job I could possibly have done and the team got a one-two.’ Hamilton’s explanation for slowing down is that he was running his own race and conserving his tyres as best suited him. No neutral I have spoken to within Formula One disputes the world champion’s rationale. Hamilton (centre) celebrates his win with the Mercedes team, but Rosberg (right) appears less pleased . Hamilton crosses the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . ‘Ultimately this is Formula One,’ added Hamilton. ‘I want the guy to be up my a*** if he’s got the pace to be up my a***, and putting pressure on me. And if I can’t defend it, I lose, like in Bahrain last year. I wasn’t quick enough and I did everything I could to stay ahead. And that was the greatest race ever.’ The greatest race of this young century, certainly. Both drivers are now spending a few days in Dubai before travelling to Bahrain for this year’s race on Sunday. Before leaving, and without knowing what Hamilton had said, Rosberg offered his considered version of events through his customary post-race video, on which he answered fans’ questions. One asked if he was ‘crying’ – by which the questioner meant moaning or being a poor loser. Rosberg said: ‘You say that I was crying. OK, I respect your opinion, and I’ll keep it in mind and I’ll try to show respect when it’s due going forward.’ Hamilton in front of team-mate Rosberg during Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai . Rosberg (right) speaks with Mercedes executive director Toto Wolff in Shanghai during the weekend . But why did he not push to pass Hamilton? ‘It might not be so easy to understand from the outside,’ said the German. ‘But the reason is, I did try to attack Lewis in the first stint, and it just didn’t work. All I did was destroy my tyres. ‘So in the second stint there was no point to do that again. I would have completely destroyed my tyres and Vettel could have had a really good shot at overtaking me. My only chance of winning the race anyway, or to fight Lewis, or try to overtake him, would have come at the end of the race, so that’s what I was building up to. ‘The worst part of the weekend was losing out to Lewis in qualifying. That compromised me most. And it was by just four-hundredths. That’s all down to me to be those five-hundredths quicker next time.’","A dispute broke out between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg on Sunday .

"It can’t receive phone calls, track your exercise or let you send messages, but an old watch made by Apple is on sale via eBay for more than the brand’s latest offering. An analogue promotional watch from Apple with a blue bezel, rubber strap and colourful hands, is listed on the internet auction site with a ‘buy it now’ price of $2,499.99 (£1,707.47) plus postage. For the same price as the 1997 timepiece, Apple fans could pre-order five of the cheapest Apple Watch Sport, which cost £299 in the UK and still have some change. An analogue promotional watch from Apple (pictured) with a blue bezel, rubber strap and colourful hands, is listed on the internet auction site with a ‘buy it now’ price of $2,499.99 (£1,707.47) plus postage . However, it is still cheaper than the Apple Watch Edition, which costs upwards of £8,000 ($10,000). The seller, called ‘theappleipodbay’ calls the watch, which was made by Quartz and released to promote Apple’s Mac Operating system, a ‘rare collector item’. ‘The watch was part of an Apple promo and has been preserved from the 1990s,' the seller wrote on their eBay page. ‘A new battery has been installed and the watch is new, never used or worn.’ It is still in its original box and the seller claims to have two to offload, with 10 days to go. The seller, called ‘theappleipodbay’ calls the watch, which was released to promote Apple’s Mac Operating system, a ‘rare collector item. This image shows the listing on the auction website . Unlike Apple’s new Watch, the vintage model has a circular screen, which has no digital capabilities and shows the company’s old rainbow hue logo. Three versions of Apple's watch (pictured) are available to pre-order online and almost one million orders are thought to have been taken in the US on the first day alone . 'Will the Apple Watch change your life? Well, possibly more than many realise until they start using it. 'After a day or two with the watch, a strange thing happened - I completely stopped checking my phone. 'While Apple may be the firm that really creates phone addiction, meaning we are constantly checking our handsets, with the Apple Watch it may have cured it. 'Apple undoubtedly has another hit on its hands with the watch. 'As more and more apps appear, and developers actually get to spend time with it, I fully expect it be used in ways we can't even imagine now. 'Much like the iPhone, apps could propel this to become a new computing platform - and even with the features it already has, the Apple watch is the most elegant way to communicate digitally.' Unlike Apple’s new smart watch, the vintage model has a circular screen, which has no digital capabilities and shows the company’s old rainbow hue logo. The International Business Times reported that the watch is almost 50 times more valuable – according to its seller – than it was a year ago, thanks to the launch of the new Apple Watch. It’s not known how many of the vintage watches Apple had made at the time, or how many still exist, but one sold on eBay in Match last year for $54 (£37). At the time of writing, two more of the watch model are listed online for $1,000 (£679) and $750 (£510), but neither have fetched that amount of money, suggesting sellers may just be trying their luck. It's thought that Apple sold almost one million Apple Watches in the US alone on the first day that the device could be pre-ordered. It goes on sale in shops in nine countries on April 24. Apple has not confirmed any sales figures, but Tim Cook, interviewed on cable television channel CNBC, said initial orders were 'great.' Slice Intelligence measured digital commerce by tracking consumer receipts to come up with its number of 957,000 American shoppers ordering Apple Watches on the first day that they could do so. Those ordering an Apple Watch Sport, the cheapest version, spent $382.83 per watch and those ordering the Apple Watch spent $707.04. 'As expected, most consumers – 62 percent – purchased the less-expensive Sport model,' said Jaimee Minney of Slice. The data also showed that most consumers opted for the larger 42 mm case. Apple predicted on Thursday that demand would exceed supply at product launch. Soon after online pre-orders opened on Friday, Apple's website listed shipping times in June for some models of the watch and four to six weeks for others. There was immediately brisk bidding on eBay for confirmed orders for watches, with hundreds of sellers looking to make a few hundred or even thousand dollars by passing on their watches, once received. ‘The watch was part of an Apple promo and has been preserved from the 1990s,' the seller wrote.

"Fighter ace: Douglas Bader's story is to be told in a Hollywood film dubbed ‘The First Great Escape’ The story of how Douglas Bader recovered from having both legs amputated to become one of Britain’s greatest fighter aces is remarkable enough. But now another astonishing but little-known chapter of his war career is to be told in a Hollywood film being dubbed ‘The First Great Escape’. Bader – who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 – was shot down over France in August 1941 and ended up in a German prison camp in Warburg. It was there that the officer, who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick, was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough. Bader’s life story has already been the subject of the successful film Reach for the Sky in 1956 starring Kenneth More. This latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the Warburg escape by historian Mark Felton called Zero Night. It was a plot hatched by Scottish lieutenant Jock Hamilton-Baillie, 23, and involved build folding ladders to escape over the wire. Major Tom Stallard, of the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. The fighter ace went on to describe it as ‘the most brilliant escape conception of this war’. The ladders were made from wood from a wrecked hut and crafted in the camp’s music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. They were disguised as bookshelves. On the night of the break – August 30, 1942 – the prisoners managed to fuse the camp’s search lights and 41 men carrying four 12ft scaling ladders rushed the fence. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the wire, of which three made a ‘home run’ back to freedom. The Great Escape: Bader's story predates the break in 1944 immortalised in the film starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough (pictured) Bader was among those recaptured but was such a nuisance to the Germans that he ended up in the ‘escape-proof’ Colditz Castle and remained in captivity until the end of the war. More than 40 Allied prisoners put their lives on the line in a plot to escape from Oflag VI-B camp near Warburg, Germany, in 1942. Major Tom Stallard, a larger than life 37-year-old from Somerset captured while serving in the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. While the Great Escape relied on its famous tunnels, the Warburg mass break out saw the men boldly leap over the huge perimeter fences using wooden ladders. Bader described what happened as 'the most brilliant escape conception of this war'. Months of meticulous planning and secret training went into the three minute charge of the camp's double perimeter fences. Bader’s life story has been the subject of 1956 film Reach for the Sky starring Kenneth More (pictured) A series of makeshift ladders propped against the prison camp's perimeter fence were made from wood plundered from a wrecked hut. They were crafted in the camp's music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. The escape was codenamed Operation Olympian because it involved troops from across the Commonwealth - Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The rights to Dr Felton’s book (pictured) have been bought by production firm Essential 11 USA . As the night of the breakout loomed, the ladders were disguised as bookshelves to fool the guards. After the prisoners fused the perimeter search lights, 41 of them carrying four 12-foot scaling ladders made from bed slats rushed to the barbed-wire fence and clambered over. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the barbed wire, of which three made a 'home run' back to freedom. Bader later ended up in Colditz and had his tin legs taken away to ensure he remained in captivity until the end of the war. Major Stallard and another leading light of the escape Major Johnnie Cousens, also of the Durham Light Infantry, survived the war and lived into their 70s. Both were too modest to breathe hardly a word about what had happened on August 30 1942. But now their story could trump the Great Escape after Hollywood bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian Mark Felton's book about the escape Zero Night into a blockbuster. The rights to Dr Felton’s book have been bought by the makers of 2013’s Saving Mr Banks with Tom Hanks. Production firm Essential 11 USA, the makers of the 2013 Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson hit Saving Mr Banks, is now working on a script. Dr Felton said a number of 'A-list' Hollywood stars were queuing up for roles and Essential 11 had invited him to help cast the leads, although he could not reveal who was interested. He said: 'I'm very, very pleased. It's very, very exciting. Essential 11 did a fantastic job with Saving Mr Banks and to have that same team working on this is very pleasing.'","Douglas Bader recovered from having both legs amputated to become one of Britain’s greatest fighter aces .

"Kent Sprouse acknowledged almost immediately after he was arrested more than a decade ago that he killed a police officer and another man outside a Dallas-area convenience store. A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. No new appeals are pending as Sprouse's lethal injection scheduled for Thursday evening approaches. He would be the fifth inmate executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row: Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) andcustomer  Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said a recent purchase of pentobarbital means they have enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.","Kent Sprouse, 42, faces lethal injection at 6pm Thursday .

"Renowned fashion designer Collette Dinnigan has placed her luxurious Paddington home on the market after splashing out on a stylish waterfront home in one of Sydney's most exclusive suburbs. The four-bedroom 19th century sandstone property cost Dinnigan $4.45 million back in 2009, and is set to go under the hammer on May 23. After purchasing a lavish $6.5 million Watsons Bay property just last month with husband Bradley Cocks, Dinnigan is hoping for a cool $6 million when the lavishly renovated Paddington house sells. Scroll down for video . Fashion queen Collette Dinnigan has put her four-bedroom 19th century sandstone property on the market . The two-storey terrace home was built in 1880, and is set on 379 square metres of prime Paddington real estate. 'It's one of the oldest houses in Paddington, and the renovations are just stunning,' said selling agent Ben Collier for MsGrath Estate Agents, who is selling the property along with Will Manning at Ballard property. The international designer and her husband carefully renovated the property to be 'very sympathetic and in keeping with the period style, while still keeping it contemporary', said Mr Collier. Mr Collier said that the owners loved the combination of the house's proximity to restaurants and cafes, along with the unusually large terrace which makes the property an actual house. 'Most terraces in the area are around six metres, but the property's terrace is about twice that,' he said. Set back from the street in the exclusive suburb, the couple share their meticulously crafted home with children 10-year-old Estella and three-year-old Hunter.

Dinnigan has been a successful designer since opening her first store  in 1992 and sells her brand in New York, London and Hong Kong . The inspired reinvention of contemporary and period style offers a selection of casual and formal living areas, which extend onto a central courtyard area with stone finish and a leafy courtyard area. The French provincial style kitchen boasts a marble island bar, which flows effortlessly onto the outdoor entertaining area. The recently configured lower level master suite features a stand alone marble bathtub. 'The fact that the master bedroom is on the ground floor is unusual, and means that the owners can live completely on one level, as the guest bedroom and bathroom is upstairs,' said Mr Collier. 'It's a wonderful property for those who want the Paddington lifestyle but don't want to incorporate multiple levels,' he said. The bedrooms are a generous size, and have built ins, surrounded by a neutral colour scheme. The exposed sandstone walls and recycled wooden floorboards add to the feeling of rustic luxury.

The Property Observer reported the house was listed for about $8 million. It was sold by Ballard Property and Sydney Sotheby's Realty on March 18. In September last year Dinnigan and her husband sold their Palm Beach home for $3.2million. The couple purchased the home in 2010 for $3million and went on to refurbish it during their four year stay. The three-bedroom property was bought by The Castle actress Sophie Lee and her husband, CEO of advertising agency Host, Anthony Freedman.
